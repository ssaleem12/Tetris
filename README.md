# Tetris

An introduction for this app is that it is a Tetris game created using C#. This app was created for one of my class at DePaul University - SE 371 Practices of Global Software Development. Using an agile project management, our class was split into groups to work on different parts of the project. Our role was to create the class for the blocks and be able to rotate them. This project taught us teamwork as well as working remotely since that was the main importance of this class.
